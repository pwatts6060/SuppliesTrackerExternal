  <h1>Supplies Tracker</h1><br>
  
  
  
Tracks supplies (food, potions, teleports, ect.), Ammo (cannonballs included), runes, and weapons charges.

Farming supplies now tracked in update 1.7

To turn on weapon charges box (tracker will no longer add each individual item used for a charge), look in configs.

Blowpipe ammo used is not actual use. It is an estimate based on number of attacks.

## Ability to save as JSON
Previous entries in normal data entry will not be added to a json file, as we do not know when they were used.
Will save all data according to the date that they were used. This can further expand to the UI panel of the plugin to show what was just used during a certain timespan.
